    <header><h2>Addition</h2></header>
    <p>You take a number of cats from one place, a number of cats from another, and you put them together.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To write down the operation, you use the symbol called PLUS.</li>
      <li>The result of the operation is called SUM.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <code>2 cats + 2 cats = 4 cats</code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="subtraction">
    <header><h2>Subtraction</h2></header>
    <p>You now have four cats. If you give a number of cats away to someone else (say, to John), you will perform subtraction; that is: you will subtract a given number of cats from the total number of cats that you have.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You write down the operation with a symbol called MINUS.</li>
      <li>The result of the operation is called REMAINDER.</li>
      <li>REMEMBER: Cat subtraction is only permissible as a thought experiment. Under no circumstances can you give away, take away, or subtract cats in any way in real life.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <code>4 cats - 1 cats = 3 cats</code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="multiplication">
    <header><h2>Multiplication</h2></header>
    <p>You now have three cats. It's high time you finally fed them.</p>
    <p>You look at your kitchen shelf and find out a box of cat food. On the back of it the instruction says an average cat needs 85 grams per serving. You want to know how much to measure out for your cats. So you multiply the recommended serving by the number of cats.</p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <code>85 grams of cat food x 3 cats = 255 grams</code>
    <p>What essentially happened is that you added the serving three times:</p>
    <code>85 + 85 + 85 = 255</code>
    <p>In this example, multiplication is a way of shortening addition when you want to add the same number over and over.</p>
    <p>Consider if you needed to add 56 USD thirty two times, in order to know how much it would cost to buy GPS tracking collars for all the cats in your neighborhood, so you can raise the amount in your community and prevent cats from getting lost.</p>
    <p>With addition, it would look like this:</p>
    <code>56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 = 1792</code>
    <p>Not too efficient or succinct, is it?</p>
    <p>But with multiplication, it would look like this:</p>
    <code>32 * 56 = 1792</code>
    <p>Simple, quick, and beautiful.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="division">
    <header><h2>Division</h2></header>
    <p>So now you know you need to raise 1792 USD for 32 cats in your neighborhood, but there are just 28 people living there (including you). How do you know the amount of money everyone needs to chip in in order to get the full sum?</p>
    <p>Simple - you divide the total cost of collars by the number of donors. Like this:</p>
    <code>1792 USD / 28 donors = 64 USD</code>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="bonus:_exponentiation">
    <header><h2>Bonus: Exponentiation</h2></header>
      <p>Remember how multiplication is just a quicker way of writing down the addition of the same number over and over?</p>
      <p>Well, think about exponentiation as a similar trick, but for multiplication.</p>
      <p>Instead of writing:</p>
      <code>2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 256</code>
      <p>You can just write "2" once and then add the number of times it would appear in multiplication. You add the number in small print just above the "2". Like this:</p>
      <code>2<sup>8</sup> = 256</code>
